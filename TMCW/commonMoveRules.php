<span class="big">Movement</span>

<p>The Second Number on the counter is Movement Points <abbr title="Movement Points">(MP)</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Units expend different amounts of <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> for different terrains.
    Also,
    different units may expend
    different amounts to enter certain hexes.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The number of movement points or <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr>'s a unit expends to
        enter a
        hex is baseed
        up both the unit type and the hex being entered. It can also be affected by the hex side be
        traversed (example, a river hexside).
        Please see the Terrain Effects Chart or
        <abbr title="Terrain Effects Chart">TEC</abbr> for the effects of terrain on movement. The <abbr
            title="Terrain Effects Chart">TEC</abbr> may be found by pressing
        the button <abbr title="Terrain Effects Chart">TEC</abbr>.

<h3>Road Movement</h3>
<ul>

    <li><p>When a unit moves from a hex containing a road, to another hex containing a road, and a road
            traverses the hexside
            be traversed, the unit may be eligible for road movement. Road movement often requires less
            <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr>'s than the other terrain in the hex.</p>
