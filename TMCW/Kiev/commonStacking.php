<span class="big">Stacking</span>
<p>
    Units may stack up to 3 units in a hex.
</p><p class="ruleComment">
    If a user right clicks on a stack of units they can cycle through all the units in the stack.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Units may stack up to 3 units in a hex at end of their movement. They pass through other friendly units in excess of that limit, provided
        they end the turn no more that 3 unit in a hex.</li>
    <li>If units are forced to retreat during combat, they must must not violate the 3 units per hex rule at any point in their retreat. Units unable to do so will take a
        one step reduction instead.</li>
    <li>Units may ignore zoc's of enemy units while retreating provided
        they are entering a hex already containing friendly units, and not in excess of the 3 units per hex rule.</li>

    <li>During combat, units stacked together may attack the same or different enemy hexes.</li>
