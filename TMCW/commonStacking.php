<span class="big">Stacking</span>
<ol>
    <li>Units may not be stacking at end of their movement. They pass through other friendly units but must end
        their phase unstacked.</li>
    <li>If units are forced to retreat during combat, they must end the retreat in an empty hex. They may
    pass through hexes occupied by friendly units.</li>
