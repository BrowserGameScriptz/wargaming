    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <h4>Historical set up (The Prussians Probably Lose)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The Russian player sets up first.</li>
        <li>He must deploy an artillery unit on the hill north of Norkitten Forrest</li>

        <li>He must deploy a cavalry unit on each hex marked RC north of Norkitten Forrest and south of the
            Alm creek.
        </li>

        <li>The balance of his units may be deployed on any hex marked "R" and or east of the line of Hexes
            marked "R"
            running from the Alm Creek north to the board edge.
        </li>

        <li>The Prussian Player sets up after the Russian player is finished setting up</li>

        <li>He must place a Prussian Cavalry unit on each hex marked "PC" North of Gross Jagersdorf and
            South of the Alm
            Creek.
        </li>

        <li>The Balance of his units must be deployed on Hexes marked "P" and or within the line of hexes
            marked "P" around
            Gross Jagersdorf.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Attempt at balance Set up Variant</h4>

    <p>The Russian player, may while deploying, removes from his OOB 1 artillery unit and 4 other units of his choice.
        The Russian player simply leaves them in the deploy box. If any are cavalry he is
        not obligated to cover all "RC" hexes though he must cover as many as he can. He must always place
        an artillery unit
        on the hill North of the Norkitten woods.</p>
