        <li>The Austrian player sets up first. The Austrian units are red and white.</li>
        <li>They may deploy any or all their units on or north of the hexes with an A on them.
            <p>Clicking on a unit will
        display all possible placements of the unit. The Austrians may deploy all, some or none of their units.</p>
            <p></p>
            Units not deployed may be placed later during a subsequent
        movement phase. (it will cost their entire movement allowance though).
        </P></li>
        <li>When the Austrian play is done deploying they should hit the "next phase" button</li>

        <li>The Prussian Player sets up after the Austrian player is finished setting up. The Prussian units are blue and yellow. </li>
        <li> They may deploy any or all their units on or south of the hexes with an P on them.<p>

                Again, clicking on a unit will
                display all possible placements of the unit. The Prussians may deploy all, some or none of their units.</p>
            <p></p>
            Units not deployed may be placed later during a subsequent
            movement phase. (it will cost their entire movement allowance though).
