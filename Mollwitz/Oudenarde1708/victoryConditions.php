        <li>
        Each side is awarded one victory point for each hostile combat factor destroyed. And
        multiple victory points for locations occupied.
            These locations are marked with numbers in red for Anglo objectives and blue for Franco Objectives.
            <p class="ruleComment">
                Note: objectives start in the possession of the enemy, so they will have a label of the opposite color
                of their number at the beginning of the game. It will switch back and forth depending upon whoever last occupied the objective.
