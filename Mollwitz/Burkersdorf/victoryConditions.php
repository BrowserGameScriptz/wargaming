                    For each city labeled "Austrian", the Prussian player is awarded 10 points if they take it. If the
                    Austrian player retakes the city,
                    the Prussian player loses the awarded 10 points.
                </li>
                <li>If the Prussian player takes the LOC hex at the south edge of the map,
                    it's the same as taking a labeled city (see above), except there are 50 points awarded or lost.
