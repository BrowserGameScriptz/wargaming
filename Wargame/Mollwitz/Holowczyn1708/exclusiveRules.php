        <p>Sheremetievâ€™s Division, Did not participate in the battle but could have done.
            At the beginning of each Russian Movement Phase starting with turn 2 the Russian player rolls a die.
            No unit deployed on one of the R6 hexes may move until a six is scored or until any Unit deployed on an R6 Hex has been attacked by the Swedes.
            In either case those Russian units may subsequently move normally

            The Swedes had pontoons available. They were unable to use them.
            As an optional rule allow the Swedes to deploy 2 pontoon markers within 2 hexes of any Swedish unit.
            This has the effect of creating clear hex in that hex for the remainder of the game and nullifying any stream hex side between the two pontoons
