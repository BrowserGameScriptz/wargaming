    <ol>

        <li>
        Each side is awarded one victory point for each hostile combat factor destroyed. And
        multiple victory points for locations occupied.
            These locations are marked with numbers in blue for Prussian objectives and red for Austrian Objectives.
            <p class="ruleComment">
                Note: objectives start in the possession of the enemy, so they will have a label of the opposite color
                of their number at the beginning of the game. It will switch back and forth depending upon whoever last occupied the objective.
            </p>
            </li>

        <li>Prussian wins: At the end of any turn prior to turn 7 that they have scored 30 or more

        points.</li>

        <li>Austrian Wins: At the end of any turn prior to turn 7 that they have scored 30 or

        more points.</li>

        <li>A Draw Occurs: If both side win on the same turn. If the prussians do not win by the end of the game.
            The Austrians win.</li>
