        <li>The Allies win if they accumulate 70 points on or before the end of turn 5.
            Or 100 points on or before the end of turn 10.
            1 point is awarded for each French strength point destroyed.
            10 points are awarded for each hex marked with a red 10 that an allied unit was the last to move through.

        <li>The French win if the allies do not win and the French have destroyed at least as many Allied strength points as the Allies have destroyed French.
