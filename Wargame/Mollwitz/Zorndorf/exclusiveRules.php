                    During the Prussian Deploy Phase, there is a 50/50 chance they will be allowed to deploy in the P1
                    Hexes, or the P2 hexes.
                    This will not be obvious until the Prussian player tries to deploy their first unit.
                    A surprise to both players.
                    <p>This reflects the fact that the prussians were performing a flanking
                    maneuver and there was a chance that russians would notice before the battle started.</p>
